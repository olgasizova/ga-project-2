# **OnBoard App - Project 2**

##**Problem:** 
Have you ever tried to collaborate with your co-workers outside of your department and simply couldn't find their contact info, what they look like, or what they do? Often-times, employees don't have their company's organization chart readily available which results in a lack of communication among teams, and missed opportunities for innovation and collaboration.

##**Solution:** 
I propose an application, called "OnBOARD" which allows for companies to customize their organization chart and access it online without the need to keep a printed version.

##**User Stories**
As a type 1 user (employee) of OnBoard app, I want to quickly find my co-worker's contact information including the address and what they look like, so I when I plan a meeting with that person I prepared. 

As a type 2 user (CEO) of OnBoard app, I want to quickly find my employee's contact information and their responsibilities, so when I go out on the field, I can call everyone by their name and know exactly what their responsibilities are. This is useful when I'm the CEO of a large company that has many office locations.

##**MVP OnBoard Features:**
1. CRUD: Creating, Removing, Updating, and Deleting an employee record
2. Address API - that will correct address http://www.yaddress.net/Home/WebApi
2. Google Maps API displaying employee location - (on the wish list)
3. Search capability - (on the wish list)
4. When clicking on a record ability to preview information about that employee

##**Technologies:**

HTML, CSS and JavaScript for front-end/client
Nodejs, Express, Morgan to build server
Mongodb to create database of employees
Google maps API (on wish list)
AJAX to communicate with server

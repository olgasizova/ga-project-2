OnBoard App

Problem: Have you ever tried to collaborate with your co-workers outside of your department and simply couldn't find their contact info, what they look like, or what they do? Often-times, employees don't have their company's organization chart readily available which results in a lack of communication among teams, and missed opportunities for innovation and collaboration.

Solution: I propose an application, called "OnBOARD" which allows for companies to customize their organization chart and access it online without the need to keep a printed version.

MVP Features:
1. CRUD: Creating, Removing, Updating, and Deleting an employee record
2. Address API - that will correct address http://www.yaddress.net/Home/WebApi
2. Google Maps API displaying employee location - (on the wish list)
3. Search capability - (on the wish list)
4. When clicking on a record ability to preview information about that employee.

Technologies:

HTML, CSS and JavaScript for front-end/client
Nodejs, Express, Morgan to build server
Mongodb to create database of employees
Google maps API
AJAX to communicate with server
